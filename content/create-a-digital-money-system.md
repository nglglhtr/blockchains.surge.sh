title: Let's create our own Digital Money (pre-Bitcoin era)
---

Now imagine you had the responsibility of creating a digital money system. You’d replace this Government entity with someother regulating entity that would still operate on norms set by the government but the transactions would be digital. You won’t be giving a printed note, you’d be sending a transaction in the form of bits through the Internet.

You’d probably have two problems to solve:

1. How to prevent double spending (A gives ₹10 to B, A gives the same ₹10 to B)
2. How to secure it from hackers

[[Double spending]] can be prevented by issuing serial numbers to each token/coin/note (which you see on a printed note as well). Security could be employed to the place that is issuing these serial numbers. So you come up with a solution, a central authority that issues serial numbers, signs each transaction and keeps a record of all the transactions ever made.

1. You get a single break point for the system. Break the server, break the system.
2. One could track all the transactions made by a single person by tracking the serial numbers
