Bitcoin was no doubt the first of its kind, the amalgamation of [[equally ingenious innovations]] that preceded its birth. Bitcoin can be said to be a *particular application* of *Blockchain*, the technology upon which the cryptocurrency sits upon. To break it down, blockchain is a ‘data structure’, and by data structure it is meant that it is an encapsulation of data and methods to operate on that data. The nearest known data structure analogised to Blockchain could be a Linked List.

Each node in a linked list points to the next node. In a blockchain, each *block* points to the previous block. Each block contains *transactions*, and each transaction is an *exchange* of a *digital asset*. In case of Bitcoin, that digital asset is a coin having a monetary value. Now, when **A** sends money to **B**, the record of this transaction (this exchange of value) is added to the block for anyone in future to check the validity of **B** being the true owner of that value. When a certain number of transactions are added to a block, it gets linked to the blockchain. The number of blocks keep adding to its length.

But why do we need such a fancy new currency in the first place? [[How is it different from Fiat?]]
