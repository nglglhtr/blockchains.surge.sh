Hi, I'm Angela, and I'm fascinated by the idea of [[thinking in graphs]].

Fascinated because now there are projects and communities around [[transforming our interaction with tech]] - incorporating the way we think at the core. ðŸ§ 

Our knowledge archives are put up in lists, bulleted points, or in a pile of books and I believe knowledgeÂ is faaaar from that (lists are important, but not representative). We *think* inÂ graphsÂ and it is imperative to represent our thoughts as such. Now, you might say that would be a problem in discoverability - but that's where the fun starts! you'll simply land where your intrigue leads you to ðŸ˜‰
