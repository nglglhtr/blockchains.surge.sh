title: Life in a Transaction Output
---

> Going deeper into the Ledger

We live our lives chained to our thoughts, chained to the actions we have made uptil this very moment, where we stand. All these actions taken by each one of us form the current state of all the unspent transactions output. A single transaction generates multiple outputs to the current state of UTXOs. Each action is an amalgamation, a motivation, dovetailing from all the previous actions either received or given out. The input of the next transaction between two humans is the output of all the previous transactions ever happened.

An individual is the sum of all unspent transactions in their name. Spendable by only their name, unlocked with their intent. An individual, therefore, is sum of intent. He doesn't exist as much as the balance doesn't exist. It is ephemeral, it is a flow of intent, from action to action, from transaction to transaction. And, just like a wallet, the body is a display of the sum of these UTXOs, in a constant flow with other UTXOs.
