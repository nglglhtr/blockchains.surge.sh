title: How is Bitcoin different from Fiat currency?
---

[Money](https://kernel.community/module-0/money-language/) isn’t exactly real. It is something societies agree to assign value to. Something each person agrees to have a particular value, including the government. Fiat currency is money backed by the government. Government owns and regulates it.

Two people exchanging a ₹10 note, (1) Promise to pay the bearer the sum (as it is written on the note) and (2) This very promise is signed by the Government (the Governor of RBI).

But what if, you had the responsibility to [[create a digital money system]]!?
